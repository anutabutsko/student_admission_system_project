Max Heap-based Student Admission System

Project Description:

Introduction

This project focuses on developing an algorithm for a student admission system. The primary objective
is to efficiently process student applications, prioritize them based on various criteria, and make
admission offers to the most qualified candidates. This document outlines the algorithm's design,
design choices, testing methodology, and potential future extensions.

Algorithm Description

The algorithm chosen for this project is the Max Heap Priority Queue algorithm. This algorithm was
selected due to its favorable time complexity for searching (O(n log n)), as well as its ability to
keep the highest-priority element readily available at the top of the queue. In our case, the next
priority student is always at the front of the queue.

Our algorithm starts with the students being input as a list of dictionaries, with each student
represented by a complete dictionary. From there, a priority ranking is assigned to each student
based on:
- Student type (e.g., Graduate students have higher priority)
- Background in computer science or math
- Academic year (higher year indicates higher priority)
- Registration day for orientation (earlier registration is higher priority)
Additionally, a unique identifier is assigned to each student. The result is a list of students,
with each element in the list containing the unique identifier and the ranking.

Once we have processed the students and determined who will be admitted to the class, we reattach
the student details and output the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

Design Choices

Data Structures
Max Heap: A max heap was used as a priority queue to efficiently maintain the order of students based
on their admission criteria.
Student Data Structure: Student information is represented as dictionaries.
Pandas DataFrame: After processing the students, the algorithm reattaches student details and outputs
the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

Reasons for Design Choices

Max Heap: Max heaps efficiently maintain the order of students based on their priorities. As students
are processed and prioritized, a max heap ensures that the highest priority students are always at
the front, simplifying admission decisions.
Student Data Structure: Using dictionaries to represent student data simplifies data access and
manipulation. It provides a clear structure for each student's attributes, making the code more
readable and maintainable.
Pandas DataFrame: Utilizing Pandas DataFrames facilitates efficient data handling, transformation,
and export. It allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Testing Methodology

Each function in the algorithm was individually tested with various inputs to verify correctness.
This included testing the max heap operations, priority calculations, and admission processes.
Then, the entire admission process, from processing applications to making admission offers and
generating DataFrames, was tested using randomly generated data. This ensured that the complete
system worked as expected. In addition, the algorithm was tested with edge cases, such as when the
number of applicants is less than 25 or when there are ties in priority scores. These tests helped
identify and handle exceptional scenarios.
The testing process validated the correctness and efficiency of the admission algorithm. It
successfully prioritized students based on the specified criteria, made admission offers to the most
qualified candidates, and generated Pandas DataFrames for further analysis. The algorithm
demonstrated robustness in handling various scenarios and edge cases.

Possible Future Extensions

There are several potential future extensions for this project:
Web Interface: Developing a user-friendly web interface for applicants to submit their information
and check their admission status.
Real-Time Data: Integrating the system with a database to handle real-time data updates and provide
instant admission results.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizing machine learning models to improve the admission process by
predicting student success or department fit based on historical data.
